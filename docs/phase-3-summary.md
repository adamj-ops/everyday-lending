## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Draw Workflow State Machine
```typescript
// State transitions: Requested ‚Üí Reviewed ‚Üí Approved ‚Üí Inspected ‚Üí Disbursed
const drawStates = {
  REQUESTED: 'requested',
  REVIEWED: 'reviewed',
  APPROVED: 'approved',
  INSPECTED: 'inspected',
  DISBURSED: 'disbursed',
  REJECTED: 'rejected',
  FAILED: 'failed'
};

// State transition validation
const validTransitions = {
  [drawStates.REQUESTED]: [drawStates.REVIEWED, drawStates.REJECTED],
  [drawStates.REVIEWED]: [drawStates.APPROVED, drawStates.REJECTED],
  [drawStates.APPROVED]: [drawStates.INSPECTED, drawStates.REJECTED],
  [drawStates.INSPECTED]: [drawStates.DISBURSED, drawStates.FAILED],
  [drawStates.DISBURSED]: [] // Terminal state
};
```

### Supabase Storage Integration
```typescript
// File organization structure
const fileStructure = {
  'draw-photos/': {
    'draw-{drawId}/': {
      'inspection-{inspectionId}/': {
        'photo-{timestamp}.jpg': 'Original photo',
        'photo-{timestamp}-thumbnail.jpg': 'Generated thumbnail'
      },
      'metadata.json': 'File metadata and annotations'
    }
  },
  'draw-documents/': {
    'draw-{drawId}/': {
      'invoices/': 'Invoice documents',
      'receipts/': 'Receipt documents',
      'lien-waivers/': 'Lien waiver documents'
    }
  }
};
```

### Budget Validation Logic
```typescript
// Budget validation against remaining construction budget
async validateBudget(loanId: number, requestedAmount: number): Promise<boolean> {
  const loan = await this.loanService.getLoanById(loanId);
  const existingDraws = await this.getDrawsByLoanId(loanId);
  const totalDrawn = existingDraws.reduce((sum, draw) => sum + draw.amount, 0);
  const remainingBudget = loan.constructionBudget - totalDrawn;

  if (requestedAmount > remainingBudget) {
    throw new BudgetExceededError(requestedAmount, remainingBudget);
  }

  return true;
}
```

### Mobile Inspector App Features
```typescript
// Photo capture and upload functionality
const handlePhotoCapture = async (file: File) => {
  try {
    const uploadResult = await storageService.uploadPhoto(drawId, file, 'inspection');
    setPhotos(prev => [...prev, uploadResult]);
    toast.success('Photo uploaded successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error('Failed to upload photo');
    console.error('Photo upload error:', error);
  }
};

// Inspection completion with photos and notes
const handleInspectionComplete = async () => {
  try {
    await drawService.completeInspection(drawId, inspectorId, photos);
    toast.success('Inspection completed successfully');
    router.push('/inspections');
  } catch (error) {
    toast.error('Failed to complete inspection');
    console.error('Inspection completion error:', error);
  }
};
```
