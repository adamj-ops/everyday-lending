## Key Architectural Decisions

### Core Technology Stack
| Decision | Technology | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Database** | Supabase (PostgreSQL) | Realtime + Storage + RLS + Edge Functions integrated |
| **Architecture** | Enhanced Modular Monolith | Clear boundaries via 15 services, simple deploys, future-proof |
| **API Pattern** | REST + RPC Hybrid | CRUD via REST, workflows via RPC verbs |
| **State Machines** | XState v5 | Visual statecharts, testable, audit trails |
| **Background Jobs** | Inngest + Supabase Functions | Scheduled/long-running + DB triggers |
| **Caching** | Redis (Upstash) + TanStack Query | Server + client caching for <500ms UX |
| **Auth** | Clerk | RBAC + org multi-tenancy out-of-box |
| **File Storage** | Supabase Storage | S3-compatible with RLS, image transformations |
| **Payments** | Stripe Connect + Plaid | Industry standard combo for marketplace |
| **Search** | Meilisearch | Fuzzy search for Cmd+K, typo-tolerant |
| **UI** | Shadcn UI + Radix | Copy-paste components, full ownership |
| **Forms** | React Hook Form + Zod | Shared client/server validation |
| **i18n** | next-intl | Type-safe, App Router compatible |
| **Monitoring** | Sentry + PostHog + Better Stack | Errors + analytics + logs |
| **Deployment** | Vercel + GitHub Actions | Zero-config + PR previews |
| **Testing** | Vitest + Playwright | Unit + E2E, 70-80% coverage target |

## Risk Management

### Top 5 Risks & Mitigations
1. **Payment Webhook Complexity** (Medium/High)
   - **Mitigation:** Idempotency keys, replay protection, dead-letter queues, comprehensive integration tests

2. **RLS Policy Bugs** (High/Critical)
   - **Mitigation:** Start permissive, automated tests, weekly security review, feature flags for emergency disable

3. **Timeline Creep** (High/High)
   - **Mitigation:** Weekly increments, scope guards (PRD "Out of Scope"), feature flags for risky items

4. **Realtime Sync Edge Cases** (Medium/Medium)
   - **Mitigation:** React Query invalidation + polling fallback, reconnection tests, optimistic UI with rollback

5. **Team Burnout** (Medium/Critical)
   - **Mitigation:** Sustainable pace, no crunch, celebrate milestones, Week 15-16 lower intensity
