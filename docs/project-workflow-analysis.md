## Project Context Summary

**What We're Building:**
A complete, production-ready loan management platform that handles the entire loan lifecycle with modern Attio-style UX.

**Why It Matters:**
The current platform has an excellent foundation (8.0/10) but lacks the critical business logic and workflows needed to operate as a real lending platform. This project fills those gaps while elevating the user experience to modern SaaS standards.

**How We'll Build It:**
Leveraging the existing solid foundation, we'll add a comprehensive service layer, implement state-driven workflows, integrate payment processing, and create a beautiful, powerful user interface inspired by Attio's UX patterns.

**Success Looks Like:**
- ✅ Complete loan lifecycle management
- ✅ Automated payment processing
- ✅ Beautiful, efficient UI
- ✅ 40%+ test coverage
- ✅ Production-ready platform
- ✅ Happy users (borrowers and lenders)
