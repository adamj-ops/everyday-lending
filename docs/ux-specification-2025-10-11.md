# Design Thinking Session: Everyday Lending Platform UX Specification

**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Facilitator:** adam
**Design Challenge:** Create an Attio-style design system and UX specification for a modern lending platform

---

## 🎯 Design Challenge

**How might we design a lending platform UX that makes complex loan workflows feel effortless, empowering lenders to move at the speed of thought through keyboard-first interactions, contextual intelligence, and delightful micro-interactions - inspired by Attio's design excellence?**

### Context
- **Target Users:** Hard money lenders, loan officers (primary), loan servicers (secondary)
- **Core Problem:** Existing loan servicing tools are fragmented, slow, manual, and lack contextual intelligence
- **Success Vision:** Users describe platform as "fast," "intuitive," and "delightful" - feeling like modern tools (Linear, Notion, Attio)
- **Performance Target:** <500ms interaction time, instantaneous UI feedback
- **Tech Foundation:** Next.js 15, Shadcn UI, Tailwind CSS 4, TypeScript, Clerk, TanStack Query

### Attio-Inspired Features
- Command Palette (Cmd+K) as central navigation hub
- Inline editing (Notion-like but structured)
- Contextual sidepanels with live relationship views
- Subtle motion and visual rhythm
- Fast list navigation (J/K keys, predictive search)
- Real-time collaboration with optimistic updates

---

## 👥 EMPATHIZE: Understanding Users

### User Insights

**Who we’re designing for**
- Primary: Hard money lenders / senior loan officers handling 10–30 active deals, often closing within 24–72 hours.
- Secondary: Loan servicers managing payments, reconciliations, statements, and compliance tasks.

**What they’re trying to accomplish**
- Move a deal from inquiry → funding → servicing with minimal context switching.
- Get to a trustworthy “one‑line answer” fast: *status, next action, owner, amount, date*.
- Reduce double entry across email, Excel, QuickBooks, e‑signature, and storage.
- Answer inbound questions in &lt; 10 seconds (borrowers, lenders, managers).
- Keep a clean audit trail without extra work.

**Pain patterns we repeatedly experience**
- Fragmented toolchain: email, sheets, accounting, doc storage, and LOS all out of sync.
- Manual allocations and recalculations (interest, late fees, payoffs, draw balances).
- “Where is this deal?” ambiguity and ownership confusion.
- Slow UIs and spinners that break concentration under deadline.
- Re‑typing the same data in multiple places (no entity linking).
- Mismatched numbers between systems that erode trust.

**Delight patterns that keep showing up**
- Keyboard‑first flows (Cmd/Ctrl+K, J/K navigation, quick actions).
- Inline edit with instant recalculation + optimistic save.
- Contextual relationship sidepanels that eliminate hunting.
- Clear, compact tables with predictable shortcuts.
- Auto‑generated artifacts (term sheet, statements, payoff quotes) from current truth.
- A living audit log (“who did what, when, and why”) surfaced right where we work.

### Key Observations

**Key observations (from lived experience)**
1. **Speed = trust.** If the system answers in &lt;500ms and shows the *next action* unambiguously, users accept it as the source of truth.
2. **Relationships are the product.** Borrower ⇄ Loan ⇄ Property ⇄ Lender is the core mental model. Surfacing these links reduces 80% of hunting.
3. **Most fields are noise most of the time.** Progressive disclosure keeps power without clutter—show the 20% that matters, reveal the rest on intent.
4. **Manual recalculation is the silent tax.** Payoffs, allocations, and draw math must be automatic but human‑overrideable with audit.
5. **Context switching kills flow.** The more we can do with the palette, inline edit, and drawers, the fewer full‑page navigations we need.
6. **Narrative beats raw logs.** A “Deal Journal” (chronological, human‑readable story of events, decisions, docs, and numbers) outperforms raw event tables for daily work and audits.

### Empathy Map Summary

### Persona: **Sarah Martinez** — Senior Loan Officer (Fix‑and‑Flip, $250k in 48 hours)

**SAYS**
- “Give me the status in one line.”
- “Don’t make me click five places for basic answers.”
- “If I can’t answer the borrower in 10 seconds, we look sloppy.”
- “I’ll just do it in Excel if this slows me down.”
- “Who owns the next step?”

**THINKS**
- “Am I going to miss the wire cutoff?”
- “Is the data clean or am I about to quote the wrong payoff?”
- “Why do these dates/amounts differ between systems?”
- “I wish late fees and allocations just calculated themselves—with an override.”
- “Please, one place to see the whole story.”

**DOES**
- Triage inquiry from email → spins up intake, runs quick LTV/DSCR calc, starts doc checklist.
- Opens email, spreadsheet, e‑signature, accounting, and chat—often all at once.
- Keeps a personal “heat map” of deals (hot/warm/cold) outside the system.
- Uses keyboard shortcuts everywhere (Cmd/Ctrl+K, J/K list nav, ⌘Enter to save).
- Creates ad‑hoc checklists and templates to bridge gaps.

**FEELS**
- Anxious under tight deadlines; frustrated when numbers don’t match.
- Relief when a single view shows status, owner, next action, and blockers.
- Proud when she closes in 48 hours and makes the borrower feel supported.
- Irritated by spinners, page reloads, and long forms.

**Two visceral stories**
- *Frustration:* Needing a payoff quote while on the phone with a borrower; interest accrual off by three days between “system” and Excel. No quick override surfaced. Manually recalculated while the borrower waited; felt blind and exposed.
- *Delight:* Hit Cmd+K to find a loan by code, sidepanel opened with live balance and history; edited rate inline, payment schedule recalculated instantly, and a ready‑to‑send email template appeared with the new terms. Felt like the system “got” her.

**Unspoken need → Design Opportunity**
- A first‑class **Deal Journal**: a chronological, human‑readable narrative that composes events, decisions, docs, and number snapshots. It’s the canonical memory and the audit log we actually want to read. Enable quick excerpts for emails and statements.

## 🎨 DEFINE: Frame the Problem

### Point of View Statement

**Sarah Martinez (Senior Loan Officer) needs a platform that moves at the speed of thought and holds the complete truth of every deal because her credibility with borrowers and partners depends on giving instant, accurate answers under extreme time pressure, and fragmented tools make her feel blind, slow, and exposed.**

**Core User Need:**
> "I need ONE place that knows everything, answers in <500ms, and lets me work at keyboard speed—so I can close deals fast and feel confident, not anxious."

### How Might We Questions

**Speed & Trust**
1. How might we make every interaction feel instantaneous, even with complex calculations happening behind the scenes?
2. How might we surface the "one-line answer" (status, owner, next action, amount, date) instantly for any loan?
3. How might we eliminate spinners and loading states that break concentration?

**Relationships & Context**
4. How might we make borrower ⇄ loan ⇄ property ⇄ lender relationships feel like a living, navigable graph rather than disconnected records?
5. How might we show relevant context without requiring navigation away from the current task?
6. How might we eliminate the "where is this?" hunting that wastes 10 minutes per inquiry?

**Elimination of Manual Work**
7. How might we make all calculations (interest, late fees, payoffs, draws, allocations) automatic but human-overrideable?
8. How might we prevent the same data from being entered in multiple places?
9. How might we generate artifacts (term sheets, statements, payoff quotes) from current truth with one action?

**Keyboard-First Flow**
10. How might we enable complete workflows without touching the mouse?
11. How might we make command palette (Cmd+K) the primary interface, not just a shortcut?
12. How might we support inline editing everywhere so changes happen in-context?

**Narrative & Memory**
13. How might we create a "Deal Journal" that humans want to read, not just machines need to log?
14. How might we turn the audit trail into a storytelling tool that builds trust?
15. How might we make the deal's timeline the canonical view, not an afterthought?

### Key Insights

**Insight 1: Speed IS the feature**
When the platform answers in <500ms with the right information, it becomes trusted as the source of truth. Slow = doubt. Fast = confidence. This isn't just performance optimization—it's trust-building through interaction design.

**Insight 2: The interface is relationships, not forms**
Users don't think in isolated CRUD operations. They think: "Show me this borrower's loans, the properties behind them, who participated, and what's outstanding." The UI should mirror this mental model with bidirectional navigation and contextual panels.

**Insight 3: Progressive disclosure unlocks power without clutter**
Show the critical 20% (status, amount, owner, date, next action) by default. Reveal the other 80% (detailed terms, documents, history) on hover, click, or keyboard shortcut. Density without overwhelm.

**Insight 4: Manual recalculation is hidden technical debt**
Every time a user opens Excel to calculate payoff interest or split participation amounts, the platform loses trust. Automated calculations with clear overrides (and audit trails) are table stakes.

**Insight 5: Context switching is the invisible productivity killer**
Every tool switch (email → spreadsheet → accounting) breaks flow and introduces errors. The more we can do inside the platform (command palette, inline editing, sidepanels, generated emails), the faster and more accurate users become.

**Insight 6: The "Deal Journal" could be our signature move**
Instead of event logs that serve compliance but frustrate users, create a human-readable narrative: "Sarah approved $250K at 10% on Oct 5. Mike's bank account linked Oct 6. Wire sent Oct 7 at 9:15am. First payment due Nov 7." This becomes the memory users want AND the audit trail regulators need.

## 🛠️ PROTOTYPE: Make Ideas Tangible

### Prototype Approach

**Strategy: Component Specification Documents**

Rather than high-fidelity mockups, we'll create **implementation-ready component specifications** that work with your existing Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS 4 foundation. Each spec includes:

1. **Interaction Patterns** - Keyboard shortcuts, hover states, click behaviors
2. **Visual Design** - Spacing, typography, colors, animations (referencing Tailwind/Shadcn tokens)
3. **State Management** - Loading, empty, error, success states
4. **Accessibility** - ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
5. **Technical Notes** - React Query patterns, optimistic updates, performance considerations

**Why This Approach:**
- Works with your existing component library (Shadcn UI)
- Developers can implement directly from specs
- Maintains consistency with established design system
- Faster than high-fidelity Figma mockups
- Test-driven: each spec includes key interactions to validate

### Prototype Description

Below are detailed specifications for the **5 highest-impact components** that define the Attio-style experience. These are implementation-ready and can be built in parallel.

---

## Component Spec 1: Universal Command Palette

### Overview
Central nervous system of the application. Cmd+K from anywhere opens a searchable command palette for navigation, actions, and calculations.

### Visual Design
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🔍  Search loans, borrowers, actions...            │ ← Input (focus on open)
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Recent                                             │ ← Section header (text-xs text-muted)
│  → Mike Chen - Loan #1234      Cmd+1                │ ← Recent item (hover: bg-accent)
│  → Sarah Rodriguez             Cmd+2                │
│                                                     │
│  Actions                                            │
│  ⚡ Create New Loan            C+L                  │ ← Action (icon + text + shortcut)
│  📊 Generate Payoff Quote                           │
│  💰 Record Payment                                  │
│                                                     │
│  Navigate                                           │
│  🏠 Dashboard                  G+D                  │
│  📋 Loans                      G+L                  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Interaction Patterns

**Opening**
- `Cmd+K` (Mac) / `Ctrl+K` (Windows) from anywhere
- Animated slide-down + backdrop blur
- Input auto-focused, ready to type
- ESC to close, Cmd+K again to close

**Search Behavior**
- Fuzzy search across all entities (loans, borrowers, properties, lenders)
- Results update character-by-character (no debounce)
- Up/Down arrows or J/K to navigate results
- Enter to execute selected action
- Cmd+[1-9] for first 9 results (quick access)

**Context Awareness**
- If viewing loan detail, show loan-specific actions first
- Recent items based on user's navigation history (last 5)
- Action suggestions based on current page context

**Calculation Mode**
- Type "10% of 250000" → shows "= $25,000" → Enter to copy
- Type "250000 * 0.1 / 12" → shows monthly amount
- Built-in calculator without leaving keyboard

### Technical Implementation

**Component Structure**
```tsx
<CommandPalette>
  <CommandInput placeholder="Search..." />
  <CommandList>
    <CommandGroup heading="Recent">
      <CommandItem onSelect={navigate}>
        <Icon />
        {' '}
        Loan #1234
        <Kbd>Cmd+1</Kbd>
      </CommandItem>
    </CommandGroup>
    <CommandGroup heading="Actions">
      <CommandItem onSelect={executeAction}>
        <Icon />
        {' '}
        Create New Loan
        <Kbd>C+L</Kbd>
      </CommandItem>
    </CommandGroup>
  </CommandList>
</CommandPalette>;
```

**State Management**
- Use `cmdk` library (Shadcn compatible)
- Recent items from localStorage (last 10 items)
- Actions registered globally via context provider
- Search powered by Fuse.js for fuzzy matching

**Performance**
- Prefetch top 100 entities on app load (cached)
- Debounce API search only if local cache miss
- Lazy load action list (don't render until palette opens)
- Keyboard shortcuts registered globally via useHotkeys

**Accessibility**
- `role="dialog"` with `aria-label="Command palette"`
- `aria-live="polite"` for search results
- Focus trap when open
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys or J/K

---

## Component Spec 2: Inline Editing System

### Overview
Every data field is editable in-place. Click to edit, tab to next field, auto-save on blur. No modal forms.

### Visual Design

**Read State**
```
Loan Amount: $250,000 ← Click to edit (hover: bg-accent-50)
```

**Edit State**
```
Loan Amount: [$250,000  ] ← Blue border, cursor shown
              ↓ Tab to next field
Interest Rate: [__10.0_%  ] ← Validation hint below
```

**Saving State**
```
Loan Amount: $250,000 ✓ ← Checkmark animation (green, 500ms fade)
```

**Error State**
```
Loan Amount: $250,000 ⚠ ← Red border + inline error
             "Must be > $10,000"
```

### Interaction Patterns

**Editing Flow**
1. Click any field → becomes editable input
2. Type new value → real-time validation
3. Tab → move to next field (auto-save previous)
4. Enter → save and exit edit mode
5. Esc → cancel edit (revert to original)
6. Click outside → auto-save and exit

**Optimistic Updates**
- Change appears immediately in UI
- Background API call to save
- If API fails, revert value + show toast
- Checkmark animation on successful save

**Multi-Field Editing**
- Tab through multiple fields in sequence
- Changes batch-saved on final blur
- Undo/redo (Cmd+Z) works across field changes

**Validation**
- Real-time validation as user types
- Red underline for invalid (no blocking)
- Helpful hint below field: "Must be between X and Y"
- Can't save if validation fails (Enter does nothing)

### Technical Implementation

**Component Structure**
```tsx
<EditableField
  value={loan.amount}
  onSave={value => updateLoan({ amount: value })}
  validate={value => value > 10000}
  format={value => formatCurrency(value)}
/>;
```

**Key Features**
- Custom `EditableField` wrapper around Shadcn Input
- `useOptimistic` for instant updates
- React Query mutation with optimistic update
- Zod schema for validation
- Currency formatting with numeral.js

**State Flow**
```
User edits → Optimistic update (instant UI)
          ↓
  Background mutation (API call)
          ↓
  Success: Show checkmark → Clear after 500ms
          ↓
  Error: Revert value → Show toast → Allow retry
```

**Accessibility**
- `contenteditable` with `role="textbox"`
- `aria-label` describing field
- `aria-invalid` when validation fails
- `aria-describedby` linking to error message

  >
    <PanelHeader title={borrower.name} />
    <PanelSection title="Contact">
      <ContactInfo {...borrower} />
    </PanelSection>
    <PanelSection title="Active Loans">
      {loans.map(loan => (
        <LoanCard loan={loan} onClick={openLoanPanel} />
      ))}
    </PanelSection>
  </Sidepanel>
</SidepanelStack>;
```

**Animation**
- Slide in from right: `transform-x-100` → `transform-x-0`
- Duration: 200ms, easing: `ease-out`
- Backdrop fade in: `opacity-0` → `opacity-50`

### Interaction Patterns

**Reading Timeline**
- Reverse chronological (most recent at top)
- Scroll to see history
- "Coming Up" section at bottom shows future events
- Click event → expand to show full details

**Filtering**
- Filter button opens dropdown
- Options: All, Payments, Documents, Status Changes, Comments
- Multiple filters can be active
- Search timeline: "when did we fund?" → highlights matching events

**Adding Comments**
- Hover over event → "Add comment" appears
- Click → inline textarea expands
- @mention team members (autocomplete)
- Supports markdown formatting

**Generating Artifacts**
- Select multiple events (checkboxes)
- Click "Generate Email" → pre-filled email with selected events
- Click "Copy as Text" → formatted text for reports
- Click "Export" → PDF with timeline

**Rich Media**
- Document thumbnails inline (PDFs show first page)

- Links to external resources (title + escrow)

### Technical Implementation

**Event Schema**
```tsx
type TimelineEvent = {
  id: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  type: 'milestone' | 'action' | 'comment' | 'document' | 'future';
  actor: User | 'system';
  title: string; // Human-readable
  description?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
  attachments?: Attachment[];
  comments?: Comment[];
};
```

**Component Structure**
```tsx
<Timeline>
  <TimelineFilters
    filters={filters}
    onFilterChange={setFilters}
  />
  <TimelineList>
    {events.map(event => (
      <TimelineEvent
        key={event.id}
        event={event}
        onComment={addComment}
        onSelect={toggleSelect}
      />
    ))}
  </TimelineList>
  <TimelineActions
    selectedEvents={selected}
    onGenerateEmail={generateEmail}
  />
</Timeline>;
```

**Event Generation**
- Server-side: Generate human-readable title from event data
- Template system: "{{actor}} {{action}} {{amount}} on {{date}}"
- Example: "Sarah approved $250K at 10% on Oct 5"
- Store both machine-readable (event type) and human-readable (title)

**Performance**
- Virtualize timeline (only render visible events)
- Paginate with infinite scroll (load 50 at a time)
- Cache events in React Query
- Prefetch next page when scrolling
