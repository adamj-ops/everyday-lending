# Payment Processing Service Architecture

This document explains the payment processing architecture for the Everyday Lending platform, including service layer design, external integrations, and implementation patterns.

## Overview

The payment processing system follows the **Enhanced Modular Monolith Service Layer** pattern, providing a clean separation of concerns while maintaining high performance and reliability.

## Architecture

```
API Routes (HTTP Layer)
  → PaymentService (Business Logic)
    → StripeService (Stripe Connect Integration)
    → PlaidService (Plaid Integration)
    → LoanService (Loan Data)
      → Drizzle ORM → PostgreSQL
```

## Service Layer Components

### PaymentService

**Location:** `/src/services/PaymentService.ts`

**Responsibilities:**
- Payment processing orchestration
- Payment waterfall logic (Interest → Principal → Fees → Escrow)
- Payment allocation and loan balance updates
- Webhook processing and event handling
- Error handling and retry logic

**Key Methods:**
- `processPayment(request)` - Process a payment with waterfall allocation
- `handleStripeWebhook(event)` - Process Stripe webhook events
- `getPaymentHistory(loanId)` - Retrieve payment history for a loan
- `processSplitPayment(loanId, amount, method)` - Process payments for multiple lenders
- `calculateLateFee(loanId, daysLate)` - Calculate late fees

### StripeService

**Location:** `/src/services/StripeService.ts`

**Responsibilities:**
- Stripe Connect account management
- Payment intent creation and processing
- Webhook signature verification
- Fund transfers to connected accounts

**Key Methods:**
- `createConnectedAccount(email, country)` - Create lender connected account
- `createPaymentIntent(amount, description)` - Create payment intent
- `transferToConnectedAccount(amount, accountId)` - Transfer funds to lender
- `verifyWebhookSignature(event, signature)` - Verify webhook authenticity

### PlaidService

**Location:** `/src/services/PlaidService.ts`

**Responsibilities:**
- Bank account linking and verification
- ACH transfer initiation and tracking
- Account balance retrieval
- Transaction history access

**Key Methods:**
- `createLinkToken(userId)` - Generate link token for bank account linking
- `exchangePublicToken(publicToken)` - Exchange public token for access token
- `createACHTransfer(accessToken, accountId, amount)` - Initiate ACH transfer
- `verifyAccount(accessToken, accountId)` - Verify account ownership

## Payment Waterfall Logic

The payment processing follows a strict waterfall allocation:

1. **Interest** - Apply payment to accrued interest first
2. **Principal** - Apply remaining payment to principal balance
3. **Fees** - Apply to outstanding fees (origination, processing, etc.)
4. **Escrow** - Apply to escrow account if applicable
5. **Overpayment** - Any remaining amount applied to principal

### Example Allocation

```typescript
// Loan with $10,000 balance, $500 accrued interest, $100 fees
// Payment of $1,000

const allocation = {
  interest: 500, // All accrued interest
  principal: 400, // Remaining after interest
  fees: 100, // All outstanding fees
  lateFees: 0, // No late fees
  escrow: 0, // No escrow
  overpayment: 0 // No overpayment
};
```

## API Routes

### Payment Routes

**Base URL:** `/api/payments`

- `GET /api/payments` - List payments with filtering
- `POST /api/payments` - Create and process a payment
- `GET /api/payments/[id]` - Get payment by ID
- `PATCH /api/payments/[id]` - Update payment
- `DELETE /api/payments/[id]` - Delete payment
- `POST /api/payments/[id]/process` - Process specific payment

### Webhook Routes

**Base URL:** `/api/webhooks`

- `POST /api/webhooks/stripe` - Handle Stripe webhook events
- `POST /api/webhooks/plaid` - Handle Plaid webhook events

## Database Integration

### Tables Used

- `payments` - Payment records with allocation details
- `loans` - Loan data with balance tracking
- `lenderParticipations` - Multi-lender participation splits
- `borrowers` - Borrower information for payment processing

### Payment Status Flow

```
pending → processing → completed
                ↓
              failed → retry → completed
```

## Error Handling

### Custom Error Classes

```typescript
export class PaymentFailedError extends Error {
  constructor(paymentId: string, reason: string) {
    super(`Payment ${paymentId} failed: ${reason}`);
    this.name = 'PaymentFailedError';
  }
}

export class WebhookVerificationError extends Error {
  constructor(service: string) {
    super(`Webhook verification failed for ${service}`);
    this.name = 'WebhookVerificationError';
  }
}

export class InsufficientFundsError extends Error {
  constructor(amount: number, available: number) {
    super(`Insufficient funds: requested ${amount}, available ${available}`);
    this.name = 'InsufficientFundsError';
  }
}
```

### Error Recovery

- **Failed Payments**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Webhook Failures**: Signature verification and error logging
- **Database Errors**: Transaction rollback and error propagation
- **External API Errors**: Graceful degradation and user notification

## Security Considerations

### Webhook Security

- Verify webhook signatures using Stripe/Plaid secret keys
- Implement idempotency keys to prevent duplicate processing
- Use HTTPS for all webhook endpoints
- Validate webhook payload structure

### Data Security

- Encrypt sensitive data (bank account tokens, payment info)
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Implement rate limiting on payment endpoints
- Log all payment operations for audit trails

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# Plaid Configuration
PLAID_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
PLAID_SECRET=your_secret
PLAID_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...

# Application
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.com
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

**Location:** `/tests/services/PaymentService.test.ts`

- Mock external services (Stripe, Plaid)
- Test payment waterfall logic
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Verify payment allocation calculations

### Integration Tests

**Location:** `/tests/integration/PaymentService.integration.test.ts`

- Use real database (PGlite) for testing
- Mock external APIs with realistic responses
- Test full payment lifecycle end-to-end
- Test webhook processing with signature verification

### Test Coverage Target

- ≥90% code coverage on PaymentService methods
- 100% coverage on critical payment processing logic
- Comprehensive error scenario testing

## Usage Examples

### Process a Payment

```typescript
import { PaymentService } from '@/services/PaymentService';

const paymentService = new PaymentService(loanService, stripeService, plaidService);

const payment = await paymentService.processPayment({
  loanId: 1,
  amount: 1000,
  method: 'ach',
  bankAccountId: 'bank_123',
  notes: 'Monthly payment'
});
```

### Handle Stripe Webhook

```typescript
// In API route handler
const event = await request.json();
await paymentService.handleStripeWebhook(event);
```

### Get Payment History

```typescript
const history = await paymentService.getPaymentHistory(loanId);
console.log(`Found ${history.length} payments`);
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Payment Processing

- **Single Payment**: <100ms average processing time
- **Split Payment**: <200ms for 3 lenders
- **Webhook Processing**: <50ms average response time
- **Database Operations**: <10ms per query

### Scalability

   - Review error logs for specific failure reasons

2. **Webhook Verification Failures**
   - Ensure webhook secrets are correctly configured
   - Verify signature header is present
   - Check webhook payload structure

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is correct

   - Monitor database performance

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting `NODE_ENV=development` and `DEBUG=payment:*` environment variables.
