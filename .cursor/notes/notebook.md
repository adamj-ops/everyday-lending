- Shadcn UI initialized with Neutral color scheme
- Base components added: button, card, input, table, dialog, sheet, dropdown-menu, navigation-menu
- Database URL configured in .env.local
- Project structure follows Next.js 14 App Router patterns

## Design System Implementation
- Using Shadcn UI as base component system
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom tokens

## Database Schema Planning
Need to design tables for:
- **loans** (core loan information)
- **borrowers** (borrower details)
- **lenders** (investor/lender information)
- **properties** (property details)
- **payments** (payment transactions)
- **rehab_draws** (rehabilitation draws)
- **servicing_income** (servicing fees and income)
- **fee_types** (configurable fee types)
