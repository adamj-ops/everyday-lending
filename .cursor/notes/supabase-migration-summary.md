# Supabase Migration Summary - October 11, 2025

## ✅ Migration Complete!

Successfully migrated from Airtable-synced pipeline system to the Everyday Lending platform schema.

---

## What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Database Wipe & Schema Migration

**Dropped Old Tables:**
- `pipelines` (4 rows)
- `pipeline_stages` (21 rows)  
- `records` (2,116 rows)
- `pipeline_movements` (0 rows)
- `pipeline_rules` (0 rows)

**Created New Tables:**
- `borrowers` - Loan applicants
- `lenders` - Capital providers
- `loans` - Loan agreements
- `properties` - Property collateral
- `payments` - Payment tracking
- `rehab_draws` - Construction loan draws
- `lender_participations` - Multi-lender syndication
- `fee_types` - Fee definitions
- `servicing_income` - Servicing fee tracking

**Enums Created:**
- `loan_status`: active, paid_off, defaulted, foreclosed, cancelled
- `payment_type`: principal, interest, fees, escrow, late_fee, prepayment
- `draw_status`: pending, approved, disbursed, rejected

---

### 2. ✅ Row Level Security (RLS) Enabled

**Security Policies Applied:**
- All 9 tables have RLS enabled
- Basic authenticated user policies created (read/write for all authenticated users)
- **Production Note:** These policies should be refined with organization-based multi-tenancy using Clerk's organization IDs

**Security Advisor Status:**
- ✅ All RLS warnings resolved
- ⚠️ 2 warnings remain for old staging functions (safe to ignore)
- ⚠️ 1 warning about Postgres version update (non-critical)

---

### 3. ✅ Test Data Inserted

**Borrowers:** 3 test borrowers
- Mike Chen (Fresno, CA) - Credit: 720, Income: $125K
- Sarah Martinez (Sacramento, CA) - Credit: 680, Income: $85K
- John Davis (San Diego, CA) - Credit: 650, Income: $95K

**Lenders:** 2 test lenders
- Apex Capital - $50M capacity
- Partner Fund LLC - $25M capacity

**Properties:** 3 test properties
- 123 Oak Street, Fresno - Single Family, $250K value
- 456 Maple Drive, Sacramento - Single Family, $400K value
- 789 Cedar Lane, San Diego - Multi-Family, $600K value

**Loans:** 3 active loans
- LN-2025-001: $250K @ 10%, 6-month term (Mike Chen)
- LN-2025-002: $300K @ 9.5%, 12-month term (Sarah Martinez)
- LN-2025-003: $450K @ 11%, 12-month term (John Davis)

**Lender Participations:** 5 syndication records
- Loan 1: Apex 60% + Partner Fund 40%
- Loan 2: Apex 100%
- Loan 3: Apex 60% + Partner Fund 40%

**Payments:** 6 payment records
- Mix of interest-only and principal payments
- ACH and wire transfer methods

**Rehab Draws:** 4 draw requests
- Loan 1: 3 draws (disbursed, approved, pending)
- Loan 3: 1 draw (disbursed)

**Fee Types:** 5 standard fees
- Origination Fee (2%)
- Processing Fee ($500)
- Inspection Fee ($350)
- Late Payment Fee ($50)
- Wire Transfer Fee ($35)

---

### 4. ✅ TypeScript Types Generated

**File Created:** `/src/types/supabase.ts`

**Includes:**
- Full `Database` type with all tables
- `Tables<>` helper for row types
- `TablesInsert<>` helper for insert operations
- `TablesUpdate<>` helper for update operations
- `Enums<>` helper for enum types
- Type-safe relationship definitions
- Constants for enum values

**Usage Example:**
```typescript
import { Database, Tables } from '@/types/supabase';

type Loan = Tables<'loans'>;
type NewLoan = Database['public']['Tables']['loans']['Insert'];
```

---

### 5. ✅ API Routes Verified

**Existing API Routes:**
- ✅ `/api/borrowers` - GET, POST
- ✅ `/api/borrowers/[id]` - GET, PATCH, DELETE
- ✅ `/api/lenders` - GET, POST
- ✅ `/api/lenders/[id]` - GET, PATCH, DELETE
- ✅ `/api/loans` - GET, POST
- ✅ `/api/loans/[id]` - GET, PATCH, DELETE
- ✅ `/api/properties` - GET, POST
- ✅ `/api/properties/[id]` - GET, PATCH, DELETE

**API Status:**
- All routes use Drizzle ORM with proper schema definitions
- Validation via Zod schemas
- Search functionality implemented
- Loan calculator utilities integrated
- Foreign key relationships properly queried

**Missing API Routes (Future Development):**
- `/api/payments` - Payment CRUD
- `/api/rehab-draws` - Draw management
- `/api/lender-participations` - Participation tracking
- `/api/fee-types` - Fee management
- `/api/servicing-income` - Income tracking

---

## Database Connection Info

**Connection Method:** Supabase MCP (Model Context Protocol)

**Test Query to Verify:**
```typescript
// Get all loans with borrower and property info
const loans = await db
  .select()
  .from(loans)
  .leftJoin(borrowers, eq(loans.borrowerId, borrowers.id))
  .leftJoin(properties, eq(loans.propertyId, properties.id));
```

---

## What's Next?

### Immediate Tasks:

1. **Refine RLS Policies** (Week 1)
   - Implement organization-based multi-tenancy
   - Use Clerk's `organizationId` for data isolation
   - Create role-based policies (admin, lender, servicer, borrower)

2. **Add Missing API Routes** (Week 1-2)
   - Payments CRUD operations
   - Rehab draws workflow
   - Lender participations management
   - Fee types and servicing income

3. **Update Drizzle Schema** (Optional)
   - Consider syncing `src/models/Schema.ts` with Supabase types
   - Or use Supabase types as source of truth going forward

4. **Add Database Indexes** (Week 2)
   - Index foreign keys for performance
   - Index frequently searched fields (email, loan_number)
   - Add composite indexes for common queries

### Architecture Decisions:

**Decision Point: Drizzle vs Supabase Client**

Currently using **Drizzle ORM** for database access. Options:

**Option A: Keep Drizzle** (Current)
- ✅ Type-safe SQL queries
- ✅ Migrations in version control
- ✅ Existing codebase already uses it
- ❌ No Supabase Realtime features
- ❌ No Supabase RLS automatic enforcement

**Option B: Switch to Supabase Client**
- ✅ RLS policies automatically enforced
- ✅ Realtime subscriptions out of the box
- ✅ Supabase Storage, Auth integration
- ❌ Less type-safe than Drizzle
- ❌ Would require refactoring all API routes

**Option C: Hybrid Approach** (Recommended in Architecture Doc)
- Use Drizzle for complex queries and migrations
- Use Supabase client for realtime and RLS-protected operations
- Best of both worlds

## Testing the Migration

### Quick Verification Queries:

```sql
-- Count records in each table
SELECT 
  'borrowers' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM borrowers
UNION ALL
SELECT 'lenders', COUNT(*) FROM lenders
UNION ALL
SELECT 'loans', COUNT(*) FROM loans
UNION ALL
SELECT 'properties', COUNT(*) FROM properties
UNION ALL
SELECT 'payments', COUNT(*) FROM payments
UNION ALL
SELECT 'rehab_draws', COUNT(*) FROM rehab_draws
UNION ALL
SELECT 'lender_participations', COUNT(*) FROM lender_participations
UNION ALL
SELECT 'fee_types', COUNT(*) FROM fee_types;

-- Expected Results:
-- borrowers: 3
-- lenders: 2
-- loans: 3
-- properties: 3
-- payments: 6
-- rehab_draws: 4
-- lender_participations: 5
-- fee_types: 5
```

### Frontend Testing:

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to borrowers page
3. Verify borrowers list loads
4. Create a new borrower
5. Repeat for lenders, loans, properties

                                 └──> servicing_income (0)

lenders (2) ──> lender_participations (5) ──> loans (3)

fee_types (5) ──> servicing_income (0)
```

## Configuration Files Updated

1. **Created:** `/src/types/supabase.ts` - Generated TypeScript types
2. **No changes needed:** `/src/models/Schema.ts` - Drizzle schema remains same
3. **No changes needed:** API routes continue to work with Drizzle

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: API Routes Not Working

**Symptom:** 500 errors when calling API endpoints

**Likely Cause:** Database connection string not configured

**Solution:** 
1. Check `.env.local` has `DATABASE_URL`
2. For Supabase: Use connection pooler URL (not direct connection)
3. Format: `postgresql://postgres.[PROJECT-REF]:[PASSWORD]@aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres`

### Issue: RLS Blocking Queries

**Symptom:** Empty results from Supabase client queries

**Likely Cause:** RLS policies blocking unauthenticated requests

**Solution:**
1. Use service role key for server-side queries (bypasses RLS)
2. Or ensure requests include proper JWT token
3. For Drizzle: Use direct connection URL (bypasses Supabase RLS)
