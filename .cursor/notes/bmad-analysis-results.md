   - Abstract business logic from API routes
   - Enable better testing
   - Improve code organization

2. **Build Loan Workflow Engine** (3-4 weeks)
   - State machine for loan lifecycle
   - Automated state transitions
   - Audit trail

3. **Payment Processing Integration** (2-3 weeks)
   - Stripe Connect or Plaid
   - ACH processing
   - Payment scheduling

4. **Document Management System** (2-3 weeks)
   - S3 storage
   - Document templates
   - E-signature integration (DocuSign)

5. **Reporting Module** (3-4 weeks)
   - Portfolio analytics
   - Delinquency reports
   - Lender statements
