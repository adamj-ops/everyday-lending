# BMAD v6 Alpha - Reality Check

**Created**: October 11, 2025
**Status**: IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION

## ⚠️ Important Discovery

The screenshots provided showing commands like:
- `npx bmad analyze --mode deep`
- `npx bmad dev --mode greenfield`
- `npx bmad start --cluster`

**These commands DO NOT exist in BMAD v6.0.0-alpha.0**

They appear to be:
- Conceptual documentation
- Planned future features
- From a different version/branch
- Part of pre-release marketing materials

## What BMAD v6 Alpha Actually Provides

### Available CLI Commands
```bash
npx bmad --help
```

**Actual commands**:
- `build` - Build agent XML files from YAML sources
- `install` - Install BMAD Core agents and tools ✅ (we used this)
- `list` - List available modules
- `status` - Show installation status
- `uninstall` - Remove BMAD installation
- `update` - Update existing BMAD installation

**NO** `analyze`, `dev`, or `start` commands.

## Actual BMAD v6 Alpha Workflow

### How to Use BMAD Agents

BMAD agents are invoked **through Cursor's @ mention system** in the AI chat, not through CLI commands.

#### Step 1: Reference an Agent
In Cursor chat, type:
```
@bmad/bmm/agents/analyst.md
```

Or:
```
@bmad/cis/agents/brainstorming-coach.md
@bmad/bmm/agents/architect.md
```

#### Step 2: Agent Loads and Shows Menu
The agent will:
1. Load its configuration from `bmad/{module}/config.yaml`
2. Greet you by name (adam)
3. Show a numbered menu of available workflows

#### Step 3: Select a Workflow
Choose a workflow by number or by typing its trigger (like `*brainstorm-project`)

#### Step 4: Agent Executes Workflow
The agent will:
- Load the workflow definition
- Guide you through the workflow steps
- Save outputs to the configured location

### Available Agents

#### BMM (BMad Method) - 11 Agents
```
@bmad/bmm/agents/analyst.md
@bmad/bmm/agents/pm.md
@bmad/bmm/agents/po.md
@bmad/bmm/agents/architect.md
@bmad/bmm/agents/game-architect.md
@bmad/bmm/agents/ux-expert.md
@bmad/bmm/agents/tea.md
@bmad/bmm/agents/sm.md
@bmad/bmm/agents/dev.md
@bmad/bmm/agents/game-designer.md
@bmad/bmm/agents/game-dev.md
```

#### CIS (Creative Intelligence Suite) - 5 Agents
```
@bmad/cis/agents/brainstorming-coach.md
@bmad/cis/agents/design-thinking-coach.md
@bmad/cis/agents/creative-problem-solver.md
@bmad/cis/agents/innovation-strategist.md
@bmad/cis/agents/storyteller.md
```

#### BMB (BMad Builder) - 1 Agent
```
@bmad/bmb/agents/bmad-builder.md
```

#### Core - 1 Agent
```
@bmad/core/agents/bmad-master.md
```

## What This Means for the Project

### What We CAN Do ✅

1. **Invoke BMM Analyst** for:
   - Brainstorming projects
   - Research (market/technical)
   - Product briefs

2. **Invoke BMM PM** for:
   - Project planning
   - PRD creation

3. **Invoke BMM Architect** for:
   - Solution architecture
   - Tech specs

4. **Invoke BMM SM/Dev** for:
   - Story creation
   - Story context
   - Implementation

5. **Invoke CIS Agents** for:
   - Brainstorming (Carson)
   - Design thinking (Maya)
   - Problem solving (Dr. Quinn)
   - Innovation strategy (Victor)
   - Storytelling (Sophia)

### What We CANNOT Do ❌

1. ~~Automated deep dive analysis via CLI~~
2. ~~Greenfield architecture generation via CLI~~
3. ~~Continuous improvement cluster via CLI~~
4. ~~Parallel agent execution~~
5. ~~Automated code scaffolding~~

These features either:
- Don't exist in alpha
- Are manual workflows through agents
- Are planned for future releases

## Revised Workflow

### For Analysis (Phase 1 - Manual)

Instead of `npx bmad analyze`, we do:

**Option A - Use Analyst Agent**:
```
In Cursor chat: @bmad/bmm/agents/analyst.md
Then select: *research
Topic: "Analyze everyday-lending codebase architecture"
```

**Option B - Use Current Cursor Agent (You)**:
The AI agent in Cursor can analyze the codebase directly using:
- `codebase_search` for semantic understanding
- `read_file` for detailed examination
- `grep` for pattern finding
- Direct analysis and recommendations

### For Architecture (Phase 3)

Instead of `npx bmad dev --mode greenfield`:

**Use Architect Agent**:
```
In Cursor chat: @bmad/bmm/agents/architect.md
Then select: *solution-architecture
```

The architect will guide you through creating architecture documentation.

### For Continuous Improvement

Instead of `npx bmad start --cluster`:

**Manual Agent Invocation**:
- Call agents as needed for specific tasks
- No automated background monitoring
- Active, not passive

## Updated Documentation Status

### Documentation to Revise

The following docs need updating to reflect alpha reality:
- [ ] `bmad-workflow.md` - Remove non-existent CLI commands
- [ ] `agent-interaction-guide.md` - Update with @ mention pattern
- [ ] `bmad-integration-summary.md` - Clarify alpha limitations
- [ ] `project_checklist.md` - Update Phase 2-4 descriptions
- [ ] `bmad-quick-reference.md` - Use @ mentions, not CLI

### What Remains Valid ✅

- Agent capabilities and expertise areas
- Workflow phases (Analysis, Planning, Solutioning, Implementation)
- CIS agent personas and methodologies
- Configuration files and structure
- General BMAD philosophy

## Actual Next Steps

### Immediate (Do Now)

1. **Test Agent Invocation**:
   ```
   In Cursor chat: @bmad/bmm/agents/analyst.md
   ```
   See if the agent loads and shows menu

2. **Manual Codebase Analysis**:
   Use current Cursor AI to analyze:
   - Architecture patterns
   - Code quality
   - Database schema
   - Component structure

3. **Update Documentation**:
   Revise docs to reflect alpha reality

### Short-term

1. **Use Analyst** for product research
2. **Use PM** for requirements
3. **Use Architect** for architecture docs
4. **Use CIS agents** for creative challenges

### Long-term

- Monitor BMAD updates for new features
- Watch for beta release with planned features
- Consider contributing to BMAD development

## Key Takeaway

**BMAD v6 alpha is an agent collaboration framework, not an automated analysis/generation system.**

Agents are:
- Interactive personas you invoke in Cursor
- Workflow facilitators
- Documentation generators
- Thinking partners

They are NOT:
- Automated background processes
- Code generators
- Autonomous development clusters

This is still valuable, just different from what those screenshots implied.

*Reality check complete. Time to work with what we actually have.*
