# Figma MCP Setup Complete - Ready for Extraction

## Status ✅

1. **WebSocket Server**: Running on port 3055
2. **Client Connected**: Figma plugin is connected (channel: o6kgncx8)
3. **MCP Server Added**: TalkToFigma configured in Claude Code

## Current Connection

```
Figma Desktop (with Attio file open)
    ↓ (via Cursor plugin)
WebSocket Server (port 3055)
    ↓ (via MCP protocol)
Claude Code (TalkToFigma MCP server)
```

## Next Steps

### To Make MCP Tools Available to Me:

**You need to restart this Claude Code session** to load the new MCP server.

**Option 1: Quick Restart**
1. Exit this conversation (Ctrl+C or Cmd+Q)
2. Start a new Claude Code session: `claude`
3. The MCP tools will be available

**Option 2: Continue Without Restart (Manual Extraction)**
Since the Figma file is already open, you can:
1. Take screenshots of the components
2. Share them with me
3. I'll extract the design specs manually

## What MCP Tools Will Be Available After Restart

Once you restart Claude Code, I'll have access to tools like:
- `figma_get_file` - Get full file structure
- `figma_get_node` - Get specific component details
- `figma_get_styles` - Get all color/text styles
- `figma_get_components` - Get component library

## What I Need to Extract

From the Attio Figma file:

### 1. Design Tokens
- Color palette (all shades)
- Typography scale (sizes, weights, line heights)
- Spacing system
- Border radius values
- Shadow definitions

### 2. Component Specifications
- **Table/List View**: Row heights, cell padding, hover states
- **Detail Drawer**: Width, header height, tab styling
- **Form Inputs**: Heights, padding, border styles, focus states
- **Badges**: Sizes, padding, colors per status
- **Buttons**: Sizes, padding, states

### 3. Interaction States
- Default
- Hover
- Focus
- Active
- Disabled
- Error

## Recommended Next Action

**For fastest results:**
1. You: Restart Claude Code (`claude`)
2. Me: Access MCP tools and extract all design tokens automatically
3. Me: Create comprehensive design system file
4. Me: Rebuild all components to match Attio exactly

**Estimated time after restart:** 15-20 minutes to extract and implement production-grade components.

**Alternative (No Restart):**
Share 4-5 screenshots and I'll start implementing immediately while we continue MCP setup in parallel.

**Which would you prefer?**
