# Session State Before Restart

## What We've Accomplished

### Phase 1: Initial Component Build ✅
- Built basic versions of LenderTable, LenderDetailDrawer
- Built LoanTable, LoanDetailDrawer with complex relationships
- Built MultiStepForm wizard and LoanApplicationForm
- Created 48 Storybook stories
- Total: ~3,500 lines of code

### Phase 2: Setup for Production-Grade Upgrade ✅
- Identified issues with basic components (lacking polish, micro-interactions, data richness)
- Created comprehensive upgrade plan
- Set up Figma MCP integration:
  - WebSocket server running on port 3055
  - Figma client connected (channel: o6kgncx8)
  - TalkToFigma MCP server configured in `.claude.json`

## What Happens After Restart

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Verify MCP Tools**: Check that Figma MCP tools are available
2. **Connect to Attio File**: Access the Figma file via MCP
3. **Extract Design Tokens**: Pull all colors, typography, spacing, shadows
4. **Extract Component Specs**: Get exact measurements for tables, drawers, forms
5. **Create Design System**: Generate comprehensive design tokens file
6. **Rebuild Components**: Implement production-grade components matching Attio exactly

### Files to Extract From Figma:
- **Attio File URL**: `https://www.figma.com/design/BlK331Wp1CJ9fUG1q98Gmt/Attio---Customer-Relationship-SaaS-UI--Community-?node-id=69-2984`
- **Key Components to Extract**:
  - Data tables (list views)
  - Detail panels/drawers
  - Form inputs and buttons
  - Status badges and indicators
  - Empty states
  - Loading states

### Expected Deliverables:
1. `design-tokens.json` - Complete design token system
2. Updated `global.css` - Tailwind v4 configuration with tokens
3. Rebuilt `lender-table.tsx` - Production-grade with micro-interactions
4. Rebuilt `lender-detail-drawer.tsx` - Polish and animations
5. Rebuilt `loan-table.tsx` - Rich data visualization
6. Rebuilt `loan-detail-drawer.tsx` - Enhanced UX
7. Enhanced `multi-step-form.tsx` - Animated progress and validation
8. Documentation of all improvements

## Background Process Running

**WebSocket Server**: `bunx cursor-talk-to-figma-socket`
- **PID**: Check with `ps aux | grep figma`
- **Port**: 3055
- **Status**: Connected to Figma client
- **Keep this running** - don't kill it

## After Restart Command

When you start new Claude Code session, say:
```
"I've restarted Claude Code. The Figma MCP server (TalkToFigma) should now be available. Please verify you can access the Attio Figma file and begin extracting design tokens and component specifications to rebuild our components with production-grade quality."
```

## Design Notes

### What Makes Components "Basic" vs "Production-Grade"

**Current Issues**:
- ❌ Single-level text (no metadata, timestamps, counts)
- ❌ No hover micro-interactions (lift, shadow)
- ❌ No inline data visualization (progress bars, sparklines)
- ❌ No contextual actions (appear on hover)
- ❌ Plain status badges (no context)
- ❌ Generic empty states
- ❌ No loading skeletons
- ❌ Basic transitions (or none)

**Target Production Quality**:
- ✅ Multi-level information hierarchy in each row
- ✅ Smooth hover states with lift and shadow (150ms transitions)
- ✅ Inline progress bars, sparklines, utilization gauges
- ✅ Contextual quick actions on hover
- ✅ Rich status indicators with metadata
- ✅ Beautiful illustrated empty states
- ✅ Skeleton loading with shimmer
- ✅ Polished micro-interactions throughout

## MCP Configuration

**Location**: `/Users/adamjudeh/.claude.json`

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "/Users/adamjudeh/everyday-lending": {
      "mcpServers": {
        "TalkToFigma": {
          "command": "bunx",
          "args": ["cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp@latest"]
        },
        "figma-desktop": {
          "type": "http",
          "url": "http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**MCP Tools Expected After Restart**:
- `figma_get_file`
- `figma_get_node`
- `figma_get_styles`
- `figma_get_components`
- (or similar tool names from TalkToFigma)

**Ready to restart!** 🚀

The WebSocket server will keep running in the background, so when you start the new session, everything should connect automatically.
